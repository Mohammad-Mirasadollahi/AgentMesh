# AgentCore Documentation Plan

This documentation tree replaces the legacy flat documents numbered 0 through 5 with an indexed, phase-based English documentation set.

AgentCore is a vendor-neutral agent control plane for AI agents, human reviewers, tools, codebases, documentation, memory, policies, and cross-department workflows. AgentCore is not an agent and does not replace agent runtimes or frameworks. It registers and supervises external agents through adapters, routes durable tickets by capability, governs execution, and records structured evidence. Its core idea is simple: AI work should not disappear into chat history.

This documentation is written for experienced software engineers, software architects, product designers, platform operators, security reviewers, and technical decision makers. It is not written as beginner-level or general-audience product copy. Feature and architecture documents should be implementation-grade specifications that combine engineering behavior with product workflow, interaction states, permissions, diagnostics, metrics, and acceptance criteria.

## Documentation Map

## Cursor IDE agent documentation (not product scope)

Configuring **Cursor** rules, skills, and optional team workspace packs is documented separately from AgentCore product phases:

- Start at [`docs/agents/00-index.md`](agents/00-index.md) (canonical source: `ai-toolstack/docs/agents/00-index.md`, synced on `install.sh`).
- Workspace rule interview: [`docs/agents/cursor-workspace-rule-discovery.md`](agents/cursor-workspace-rule-discovery.md).

This does not implement the platform rule engine under `04-rule-engine-orchestration/`.

## Replacement Goal

The old flat documents numbered 0 through 5 have been replaced. Combined design documents have also been split into separate phase-specific design files. The documentation now includes feature scope, separate design files, contracts, challenges, acceptance criteria, detailed rationale, scenarios, edge cases, operational design guidance, technical logic, algorithms, graph-backed code understanding, modular project structure, a broad software engineering playbook, professional product design and engineering specification discipline, zero-touch installation, automated bootstrap, agent and resource connectivity automation, self-service operations, autonomous question discovery, FAQ memory, batched knowledge workflows, project isolation, project composition, domain packs, feature profiles, custom rule authoring, conversation-based rule suggestions, SDK platform, SDK generation, SDK testing, admin web interface, impact reporting, Unit Test strategy, Live Test strategy, port conflict prevention, operational governance, runbooks, risk tracking, gap analysis, logical implementation examples, and verification strategy.
31. Read `/root/AgentCore/backend/docs/STRUCTURE_STANDARD.md` before creating or moving backend folders.
- `13-technology-stack-and-platform-decisions/` defines the selected technology stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, pgvector, Neo4j, Redis, object storage, messaging, observability, and deployment profiles.
- `14-api-design-and-naming-standards/` defines API endpoint naming, DTO naming, error format, pagination, idempotency, API catalog, OpenAPI, SDK, and contract governance.
