# 05 - Interoperability and Enterprise Ecosystem Index

## Mission

Connect different AI coding tools, models, IDEs, departments, humans, SDK clients, adapters, and external systems through a shared protocol, broker, developer platform, and operating model.

## Files

- `01-feature-specification.md` defines interoperability features and functional requirements.
- `02-high-level-design.md` defines actors, components, broker flow, integrations, and reliability requirements.
- `03-low-level-design.md` defines protocol validation, broker routing, adapter mapping, context injection, tenant boundaries, and dead-letter behavior.
- `04-data-contracts-and-events.md` defines protocol, broker, adapter, and workflow contracts.
- `05-risks-challenges-and-acceptance.md` defines risks and acceptance criteria.
- `06-detailed-section-design.md` provides deep rationale, protocol behavior, broker design, adapter responsibilities, edge cases, and phase output.
- `07-sdk-and-developer-platform.md` defines SDK families, developer platform, Agent SDK, Adapter SDK, Admin SDK, Test SDK, scoped clients, authentication, transport, events, errors, versioning, packaging, and acceptance criteria.
- `08-agent-communication-language-and-runtime-sdk.md` defines the agent lingua franca, translator boundary, and integrations for LangChain, LangGraph, Codex, Cursor-based workers, MCP, and custom runtimes.
- `09-multi-vendor-agent-network-ecosystem.md` defines the multi-vendor and federated-network ecosystem vision, topology layers, interaction patterns, and implementation map (demo vs roadmap).

## Related Technical Logic

- `../06-technical-logic/05-interoperability-technical-logic.md` explains Universal Agent JSON validation, broker routing, delivery semantics, adapter mapping, tenancy, and dead-letter handling.

## Related SDK Design

- `07-sdk-and-developer-platform.md` should be read before implementing SDK packages, agent integrations, adapters, admin automation, or SDK contract tests.
- `../08-software-engineering-architecture/27-sdk-engineering-and-contract-generation.md` should be read before implementing SDK package architecture, generated clients, release pipelines, and contract generation.
- `08-agent-communication-language-and-runtime-sdk.md` should be read before adding a runtime-specific agent connector or translating runtime messages.
