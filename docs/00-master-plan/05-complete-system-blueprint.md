# Complete System Blueprint

## Executive Summary

AgentCore is designed as an enterprise operating layer for AI-assisted work. The platform does not try to replace existing coding assistants, IDEs, CI pipelines, ticket systems, or human reviewers. Its job is to connect them through a shared model of memory, work, documentation, policy, and communication.

The central problem is that AI work often disappears into chat history. A developer or agent asks for a change, the model produces code, and the organization is left with weak answers to important questions: what changed, why it changed, which decision justified it, which documents are now stale, which teams are affected, and whether a human should approve the risk. AgentCore solves this by turning meaningful work into structured entities and events.

## Product Positioning

AgentCore is the vendor-neutral control plane for agentic work. It is not a single agent, an LLM, or an agent framework. It is the system that lets many independently executed agents and humans behave like a coordinated organization through adapters, capability routing, durable tickets, governance, health supervision, shared context, and audit evidence.

The boundary is strict: AgentCore may use a model for bounded control-plane intelligence, but it must not hide an internal agent runtime behind the coordinator. Codex, Cursor-based workers, LangChain applications, Qwen-powered workers, and custom services remain external managed agents. Deterministic code owns permissions, lifecycle transitions, idempotency, concurrency, and approval gates.

The platform is valuable because it gives leaders and teams:

- Accountability: every important action has an actor, timestamp, evidence, and result.
- Memory: future agents can inherit current project truth instead of repeating old mistakes.
- Governance: risky changes can be blocked, reviewed, approved, or rejected.
- Synchronization: code, docs, decisions, and tasks stay linked.
- Interoperability: different tools can coordinate without using the same vendor.
- Cost control: agents receive relevant context without sending the whole project history.

## Core Concepts

### Structured Work

AgentCore treats work as a set of structured records. Activity records answer what happened. WorkLog records summarize session outcomes. Decision records explain why. Issue records define discovered risks. Task records define executable follow-up work.

This distinction is critical. Without it, the platform becomes another chat archive. With it, the platform becomes a project memory and orchestration system.

### Current Truth

AgentCore should not inject every historical event into every prompt. Agents need the current truth first. Historical context is retrieved only when the task requires it. This prevents contradiction, reduces token cost, and makes future agents less likely to revive obsolete designs.

### Docs as Live System State

Documentation is not treated as passive text. Documents are linked to code symbols, decisions, tasks, issues, APIs, and owners. If code changes and the relevant documentation does not change, the platform detects drift and creates actionable work.

### Semantic Governance

Some rules are not simple file-path checks. A change to pricing, authentication, permissions, customer data, or production infrastructure may be risky even when the file name looks harmless. AgentCore supports natural-language policies and model-based judgment for these ambiguous cases, while still relying on deterministic checks first.

### Vendor Neutrality

Enterprises rarely use only one AI tool. One team may use an IDE assistant, another may use an autonomous agent, and another may use internal scripts. AgentCore provides a shared protocol and broker so tools can coordinate while remaining vendor independent.

## End-to-End Example

A backend agent changes the password hashing algorithm from SHA256 to Argon2.

1. The agent records Activities for changed files, tests, and commands.
2. The agent writes a WorkLog explaining the outcome and remaining migration risk.
3. A Decision is created to explain why Argon2 was chosen despite slower login performance.
4. The platform discovers an Issue: old users still have SHA256 hashes.
5. The Issue is decomposed into Tasks for backend fallback logic, data backup, migration, QA, and docs.
6. Semantic memory is updated: current password hashing is Argon2.
7. Documentation anchors linked to authentication code are checked for drift.
8. Security policies are evaluated before merge.
9. If risk is high, an approval ticket is sent to the security owner.
10. Once approved and completed, the broker publishes events to subscribed agents and dashboards.

This example shows the whole platform working as one system: data model, memory, docs, rules, orchestration, and interoperability.

## Architectural Boundaries

### What AgentCore Owns

- The canonical record of AI-assisted work.
- The shared memory and context model.
- The knowledge graph linking work, docs, code, rules, and ownership.
- The policy evaluation and escalation workflow.
- The protocol and event broker between agents and tools.

### What AgentCore Integrates With

- Source control and repositories.
- CI and test systems.
- IDEs and coding assistants.
- Ticketing systems and approval tools.
- Model providers and autonomous agents.
- Department workflow tools.

### What AgentCore Must Not Do Initially

- Replace source control.
- Replace human accountability.
- Allow unbounded autonomous production changes.
- Depend on one model vendor.
- Treat generated text as trustworthy without structured evidence.

## System Qualities

### Reliability

Every workflow must be idempotent where possible. Repeated event delivery should not create duplicate Decisions or Tasks. Failed broker deliveries must go to a visible dead-letter queue.

### Auditability

Every generated record must preserve source references. Summaries are useful, but evidence must remain reachable. Approval decisions must include actor, timestamp, presented evidence, and decision reason.

### Security

Secrets must be redacted before storage in prompts, dashboards, or broker events. Tenant and project boundaries must be enforced before context injection or event delivery.

### Cost Efficiency

The platform should prefer deterministic checks, graph lookup, Bloom filters, and cached prompt sections before using expensive model calls.

### Human Usability

Documents and tickets must be readable by humans. A reviewer should understand the risk without reading raw model logs.

## Phase Dependency Model

Phase 1 is the foundation because every later phase needs stable entities.

Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 because memory is built from Activities, WorkLogs, Decisions, Issues, and Tasks.

Phase 3 depends on Phases 1 and 2 because documentation links need code symbols, Decisions, Tasks, and current semantic state.

Phase 4 depends on the graph and memory because policies require evidence and impact analysis.

Phase 5 depends on a mature internal model because external tools need stable contracts before they can interoperate reliably.

## Definition of Complete Documentation

The documentation is complete when a team can understand:

- What the platform is.
- Why each feature exists.
- Which phase owns each feature.
- Which entities and events are required.
- Which components and modules must exist.
- Which risks and edge cases must be handled.
- Which acceptance criteria prove the phase is ready.
- How each phase connects to the others.
