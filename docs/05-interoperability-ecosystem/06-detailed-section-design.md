# Interoperability and Enterprise Ecosystem - Detailed Section Design

## Why This Phase Exists

Organizations use many tools. One team may use Cursor, another may use an autonomous backend agent, another may use a QA bot, and another may rely on internal scripts. Without a shared protocol, these tools become isolated islands.

This phase makes AgentCore the coordination layer across vendors, IDEs, agents, and departments.

## Universal Agent JSON in Detail

Universal Agent JSON is the shared language for agent communication. It should be strict enough for automation and flexible enough for different tools.

A message should explain:

- Who sent it.
- What intent it represents.
- Which domain it belongs to.
- What payload is included.
- Which Task, Issue, Decision, or artifact it references.
- What status the sender reports.
- What next action is expected.

Example intents:

- `API_READY`
- `TASK_COMPLETED`
- `DOC_DRIFT_FOUND`
- `HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED`
- `TEST_FAILURE_DETECTED`
- `DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETED`
- `DOWNSTREAM_TASK_REQUESTED`

## Central Message Broker and Pub/Sub in Detail

The broker decouples producers from consumers. A backend agent does not need to know which frontend developer, IDE plugin, QA bot, or documentation agent should react. It publishes an event. Subscribers receive what they are authorized to receive.

Broker responsibilities:

- Validate message schema.
- Authorize publish and subscribe actions.
- Route events by channel and filter.
- Preserve replay history according to retention policy.
- Track delivery success and failure.
- Send failed messages to a dead-letter queue.

## Vendor-Agnostic Adapters in Detail

Adapters translate external tool behavior into AgentCore contracts. They protect the platform from vendor-specific formats.

Adapter responsibilities:

- Normalize external output into Universal Agent JSON.
- Map external capabilities into AgentCore capability profiles.
- Inject approved context into tools.
- Respect tenant and project boundaries.
- Handle version changes and degraded capabilities.

## Cross-Domain Operating System in Detail

Engineering changes often create non-engineering work. A release may require DevOps scaling, marketing emails, support scripts, HR scheduling, or finance review.

AgentCore should allow governed cross-domain workflows without pretending every department is the same as engineering.

Examples:

- A Black Friday feature release creates DevOps scaling Tasks.
- A pricing model change creates Product and Finance approval Tasks.
- A support-impacting change creates Support knowledge base Tasks.
- A security incident creates Legal and Security review Tasks.

## Architecture Flow Notes

The interoperability layer should sit at the platform boundary. It exposes stable contracts to external tools while hiding internal implementation details.

Primary components:

- Protocol Validator.
- Broker Gateway.
- Adapter Runtime.
- IDE Extension Surface.
- Department Workflow Layer.
- Enterprise Admin Console.
- Tenant Boundary Guard.

## Module Responsibility Notes

### Protocol Validator

Rejects malformed messages and records schema violations.

### Broker Router

Routes messages to channels, subscribers, webhooks, plugins, and queues. Supports replay and dead-letter handling.

### Adapter Runtime

Runs vendor-specific adapters and maps capabilities to platform contracts.

### Context Injection Bridge

Provides external tools with only the context they are allowed to see.

### Department Workflow Mapper

Maps engineering events to governed workflows in other departments.

### Tenant Boundary Guard

Prevents messages, memory, docs, and tasks from crossing tenant or project boundaries without explicit authorization.

## Edge Cases

- A vendor changes output format: adapter version tests should catch it.
- A subscriber is offline: broker retries and then dead-letters.
- Two agents claim the same Task is complete: correlation and idempotency rules resolve duplicates.
- A department workflow needs human approval: route to approval before execution.
- A message contains sensitive evidence: redact or restrict before delivery.

## Output of This Phase

At the end of this phase, AgentCore becomes an enterprise coordination layer. Different tools can keep their own UX and models while sharing memory, events, tasks, policies, and approvals.
