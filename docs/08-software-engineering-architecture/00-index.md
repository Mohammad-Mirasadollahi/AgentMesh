# 08 - Software Engineering Architecture Index

## Purpose

This section describes AgentCore from a Software Engineering architecture perspective. It defines how the system should be engineered, modularized, built, tested, released, operated, extended, secured, automated, installed, connected, isolated, measured, and maintained.

The section is intentionally broader than a classic architecture summary. It is an engineering playbook for implementers. A developer or product designer should be able to use these documents to understand what will happen in engineering, where each piece belongs, how changes should flow, how installation should be automated, how agents and resources should connect, how projects remain isolated, how the web control surface works, and which quality gates must exist before the system is considered ready.
