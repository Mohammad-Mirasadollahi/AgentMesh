# 03 - Docs-as-Code and Synchronization Index

## Mission

Make documentation, code, decisions, and ownership part of one synchronized knowledge graph so documentation drift is detected before merge.

## Files

- `01-feature-specification.md` defines documentation synchronization features and requirements.
- `02-high-level-design.md` defines actors, components, sync flow, integrations, and reliability requirements.
- `03-low-level-design.md` defines AST anchors, hash generation, frontmatter validation, drift detection, Bloom filter lookup, and CI gate rules.
- `04-data-contracts-and-events.md` defines docs, code symbol, graph, and drift contracts.
- `05-risks-challenges-and-acceptance.md` defines risks and acceptance criteria.
- `06-detailed-section-design.md` provides deep rationale, graph design, AST anchor details, drift behavior, edge cases, and phase output.
