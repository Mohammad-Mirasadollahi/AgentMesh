# Software Engineering Architecture Principles

## Purpose

AgentCore should be designed as a maintainable software platform, not as a collection of scripts. The architecture must support incremental delivery, testability, observability, modular ownership, safe configuration, and predictable operation across development, staging, and production.

## Core Engineering Principles

### Explicit Boundaries

Each subsystem must own a clear responsibility. Memory retrieval, graph indexing, rule evaluation, broker delivery, documentation synchronization, and external adapters should not be mixed into one service or one database transaction path.

### Configuration over Hard-Coding

Runtime behavior must be configuration-driven wherever the value can vary by environment, tenant, project, or developer machine. This includes ports, model routing, weighting profiles, feature flags, storage endpoints, broker topics, retention policies, and adapter credentials.

### Replace Unsafe Defaults in Development

Development environments must not blindly use common default ports. Defaults such as database, web server, broker, vector store, and dashboard ports often conflict with other local tools. AgentCore development ports must be project-scoped, documented, and overrideable.

### Idempotent Workflows

Indexing, broker delivery, memory consolidation, task creation, graph upserts, and documentation drift detection must tolerate retries without creating duplicate logical state.

### Testable Modules

Every major module should expose deterministic inputs and outputs. LLM calls, external tools, PostgreSQL, broker, and filesystem dependencies should be behind adapters that can be mocked or replaced in tests.

### Dependency Inversion And Explicit Wiring

Business logic must depend on ports, contracts, and stable shared primitives. Infrastructure implementations must be wired at the composition root. Dependency Injection is required for databases, brokers, model providers, file systems, clocks, id generators, external tools, and configuration.

### Deterministic Engineering Seams

Time, ids, randomness, external IO, model calls, and provider clients must be replaceable in tests. Code that cannot be tested without real infrastructure should be redesigned around ports and adapters.


### Observable Runtime

Every service should emit logs, metrics, traces, health checks, and correlation IDs. Operators should be able to answer what happened, why it happened, which subsystem made the decision, and which evidence was used.

### Fail Closed for Risk

Security, billing, permissions, production deployment, customer data, and compliance paths should fail closed when validation, policy checks, or approvals are unavailable.

### Progressive Delivery

The architecture should support building the platform in phases. A team should be able to deliver Core Data Model first, then Memory, Docs Sync, Rule Engine, Interoperability, Code-Knowledge Graph, and operational architecture without rewriting earlier phases.

## Quality Attributes

### Maintainability

The system should have clear module ownership, stable contracts, small services, and versioned APIs.

### Scalability

Graph indexing, embedding generation, documentation generation, broker delivery, and memory consolidation should run asynchronously and scale independently.

### Reliability

Critical state changes must be transactional where necessary and idempotent where retries are expected.

### Security

Secrets must come from environment-specific secret stores or injected configuration, never from documentation or committed files.

### Portability

Development, staging, and production should differ through configuration, not code changes.

### Operability

Every service should have health endpoints, readiness checks, metrics, and structured logs.
