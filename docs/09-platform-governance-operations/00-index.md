# 09 - Platform Governance and Operations Index

## Purpose

This section completes the AgentCore plan from an operational and governance perspective. Earlier sections define product architecture, technical logic, code graph design, and software engineering architecture. This section defines the controls required to run the platform safely in real teams and enterprise environments.

## Files

- 01-security-access-control-and-privacy.md defines identity, authorization, tenant boundaries, data sensitivity, prompt safety, and privacy requirements.
- 02-observability-slo-and-incident-response.md defines logs, metrics, traces, SLOs, alerting, and incident handling.
- 03-ci-cd-release-and-environment-strategy.md defines CI gates, release workflow, environment separation, migrations, and rollback strategy.
- 04-data-retention-backup-and-disaster-recovery.md defines retention, backup, restore, audit evidence preservation, and disaster recovery expectations.
- 05-api-versioning-and-contract-governance.md defines API contracts, schema versioning, backward compatibility, and deprecation policy.
- 06-runbooks-and-operational-procedures.md defines standard operating procedures for common platform workflows.
- 07-risk-register-and-open-decisions.md captures platform risks and decisions that must be resolved before implementation.
- 08-glossary-and-ubiquitous-language.md defines common terminology used across the documentation tree.
- 09-automated-deployment-and-connectivity-runbooks.md defines operational runbooks for automated first installation, agent connector registration, repository registration, external resource connection, automated upgrade, drift detection, and repair.
- 10-impact-reporting-and-benefit-measurement.md defines the impact measurement framework, KPI definitions, instrumentation requirements, baseline strategy, with-or-without AgentCore comparison, dashboard states, evidence model, and reporting contracts for code generation speed, bug reduction, architecture quality, rework reduction, and token consumption.

## Why This Section Exists

A design is incomplete if it only explains features. A production-grade platform also needs security rules, operational signals, deployment strategy, data retention, versioning, runbooks, automated installation, connector onboarding, repair workflows, impact reporting, benefit measurement, and risk ownership. These documents make the AgentCore plan easier to implement, review, fund, install, connect, measure, and operate.
